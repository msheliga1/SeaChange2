All commits to this point in time have been done by one person, me Skip Cole. I had some user information on this machine from when I was 
contracting at the Library of Congress, and unfortunately I didn't notice that until just now.

And by the way, I never planned on writing this entire application by myself. I always figured we could attract an open source community to
help with this enormous job. But that has never happened.
